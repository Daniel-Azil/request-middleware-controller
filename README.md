# Request Middleware Controller

The **Request Middleware Controller** is a Python package designed to provide essential middleware functionalities to optimize HTTP request handling in web applications. This package includes a variety of middleware components such as cache control, HTTP caching, robots management, SSL configurations, and request throttling. These components aim to enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of web applications by ensuring the proper handling of HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Cache Control**: Provides mechanisms for managing caching policies for HTTP responses.
- **HTTP Caching**: Implements caching strategies to improve response times by reducing unnecessary requests.
- **Robots Management**: Handles robots.txt files and manages user-agent access control for search engines and crawlers.
- **SSL Configuration**: Helps in enforcing SSL (HTTPS) for secure connections.
- **Request Throttling**: Implements rate-limiting for controlling the number of requests made within a specified time period.
- **Testing Suite**: A comprehensive test suite to ensure proper functionality and integration of the middleware components.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`. Make sure to have Python 3.6+ installed.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/request-middleware-controller.git
cd request-middleware-controller
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
### Example Middleware Setup
To use the middleware, you can import it into your application and integrate it with your request handling framework (such as Flask, Django, or any custom HTTP handler).

```python
from requests_middleware.middleware import CacheControlMiddleware

# Example: Using CacheControlMiddleware in your app
app = YourApp()  # Assuming you have your app setup

# Apply CacheControlMiddleware to your app
app.add_middleware(CacheControlMiddleware)
```

## Middleware Components

- **CacheControlMiddleware**: Controls HTTP cache headers.
- **HttpCacheMiddleware**: Enables HTTP response caching.
- **RobotMiddleware**: Manages robots.txt content and access restrictions for web crawlers.
- **ThrottleMiddleware**: Limits the rate of requests to protect your server from overload.
- **SslMiddleware**: Forces SSL connection for secure communications.


## Running Tests

To ensure that the middleware is functioning as expected, you can run the tests provided in the repository.

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This will execute the tests for all middleware components and ensure everything is working correctly.
